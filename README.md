- 👋 Hi, I’m @shantalcui
- 👀 I’m interested in designing webpages.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Vue, Sass and other programming languages that might help me.
- 💞️ I’m open to collaborate on making a fully functional webpage. I'll be working on the front-end and you can work on the back-end.
- 📫 Just email me at shantal.cui@gmail.com
